You are an agent tasked with writing code to fulfill an instruction about a CSV file (e.g., answering a question using its contents). Your goal is to produce a correct answer while efficiently using available resources, as measured by discounted reward.

The exact CSV formatting may not be fully known. In practice, you can either proceed using reasonable default assumptions about the format, or run unit tests to verify specific formatting details you are unsure about before committing to a final answer.

Allowed actions (choose exactly ONE per turn):

1) UNIT_TESTS
Run unit tests to debug CSV formatting assumptions. Unit test outputs are perfectly reliable.
Available unit tests:
  - test_delimiter(path) -> ',', ';', or '\t'
  - test_quotechar(path) -> '"' or "'"
  - test_skiprows(path) -> 0 or 1

Format (NO code fences):
  UNIT_TESTS: test_delimiter("file.csv"), test_quotechar("file.csv")

You may include multiple unit tests in a single UNIT_TESTS action.
Each individual unit test counts toward the total number of unit tests used.

2) CODE
Write Python code toward solving the task using your current assumptions about the CSV format.
- Enclose code in ```python ... ```
- You may import pandas as pd and read the file with:
    pd.read_csv(filepath, delimiter=..., quotechar=..., skiprows=...)
- Do NOT print the entire CSV.
- If your code computes the final result, print it to stdout so it can be read from the output.

After submission, the code will be executed and its stdout and stderr will be returned.  
You may use this feedback to extract the answer, debug, run additional unit tests, refine, or write additional CODE.

3) ANSWER
Provide the final answer to the task and end the conversation.
Format exactly:
  ANSWER: <your_answer>

The conversation ends immediately after you provide ANSWER.


Reward:
- Let U be the total number of unit tests used.
- Let C be the total number of CODE actions taken.
- Final reward = correctness * (d_unit ^ U) * (d_code ^ C)

General guidance:
- Start from reasonable default beliefs about the CSV format based on common conventions or provided likelihoods.
- Both UNIT_TESTS and CODE are costly actions; neither should be treated as free.
- Use UNIT_TESTS to reduce uncertainty when the expected benefit outweighs their cost.
- Use CODE to make progress toward solving the task, but recognize that failed or repeated CODE attempts are also costly.
- Decide when it is better to verify assumptions with UNIT_TESTS versus attempting CODE earlier, taking into account
  your confidence and the relative cost of these actions.
- Decide rationally how much debugging and iteration is worthwhile before committing to a final ANSWER.
